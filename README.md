About Me 🧠
I’m a lead consultant engineer with more than eight years of hands‑on experience building XR and immersive experiences.
My career started in Unity 3D game development, where I shipped 2D/3D mobile games and gamified training tools.
Since then, I’ve designed augmented and virtual reality solutions for industrial clients, built remote assistance apps with real‑time object detection and AR overlays, and developed encrypted asset delivery pipelines for secure deployments.

In 2025, I decided to deep‑dive into machine learning and data science, enrolling in a 12‑week classroom program to expand my understanding of Python, Pandas, and NumPy.
I’m now exploring the intersection of AI, digital twins, and IoT to create smarter XR products.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me tinkering with new tools, mentoring junior devs, or daydreaming about the next big AR/VR breakthrough.

🚀 Tech Stack
I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies. Here’s a snapshot of my current toolkit:

Languages & XR:
C#, Python, AR-Foundation, HoloLens, N-real

AI & Data
LLMs, Numpy, Pandas

Cloud & DevOps
